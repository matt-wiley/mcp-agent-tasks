"""

    development_notes = """# Development Notes & Context

## Architecture Decisions
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + React Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for product images
- **Payment**: Stripe payment processing
- **Email**: SendGrid for transactional emails
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for product search

## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
- JWT access tokens (15min expiry) + refresh tokens (7 day expiry)
- Automatic token refresh on API calls
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
- Role-based permissions (user, admin, moderator)

### Product Management
- Hierarchical categories (max 3 levels deep)
- Multi-variant products (size, color, etc.)
- Real-time inventory tracking with reservation system
- Image optimization and CDN delivery
- Advanced search with filters, sorting, faceted navigation

### Order Processing
- Cart persistence across sessions
- Inventory reservation during checkout (15min expiry)
- Multi-step checkout with validation
- Payment intent creation before final submission
- Webhook handling for payment confirmations
- Automated email notifications for all order states

## Current Technical Challenges

### Shopping Cart Complexity
- Cart state synchronization between frontend and backend
- Handling price/availability changes during checkout
- Optimistic updates vs server validation
- Cart abandonment tracking and recovery

### Performance Considerations
- Product listing pagination (currently server-side)
- Image loading and optimization strategies
- Search result caching (Redis consideration)
- Database query optimization (N+1 problem in some areas)

### Mobile Experience
- Touch-friendly cart interactions
- Responsive product image galleries
- Mobile payment flow optimization
- Offline-first cart functionality (future consideration)

## Testing Strategy (Planned)
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage target
- Integration tests: Critical user flows
- E2E tests: Complete purchase workflows  
- Performance tests: Load testing checkout flow
- Security tests: Authentication and payment flows

## Deployment Strategy (Planned)
- Docker containers for consistent deployment
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- Automated database migrations
- CDN for static asset delivery
- Health checks and auto-recovery
- Monitoring and alerting setup
