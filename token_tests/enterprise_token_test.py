### API Design Patterns

#### RESTful Endpoint Structure
```typescript
// Customer Management API
GET    /api/v1/customers                    // List customers with filtering
POST   /api/v1/customers                    // Create new customer  
GET    /api/v1/customers/{id}               // Get customer details
PUT    /api/v1/customers/{id}               // Update customer
DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}               // Soft delete customer

// Advanced search and filtering
POST   /api/v1/customers/search             // Complex search queries
GET    /api/v1/customers/export             // Export customer data
POST   /api/v1/customers/bulk-update        // Bulk operations

// Opportunity Management API  
GET    /api/v1/opportunities                // List opportunities
POST   /api/v1/opportunities                // Create opportunity
GET    /api/v1/opportunities/{id}           // Get opportunity details
PUT    /api/v1/opportunities/{id}           // Update opportunity
POST   /api/v1/opportunities/{id}/advance   // Move to next stage
POST   /api/v1/opportunities/{id}/close-won // Mark as closed won
POST   /api/v1/opportunities/{id}/close-lost // Mark as closed lost

// Pipeline and forecasting
GET    /api/v1/pipelines                    // Get pipeline definitions
GET    /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/forecast      // Pipeline forecast data
GET    /api/v1/users/{id}/pipeline          // User's pipeline view
```

#### Request/Response Patterns
```typescript
// Standardized API response format
interface ApiResponse<T> {
    success: boolean;
    data: T;
    metadata?: {
        page?: number;
        pageSize?: number;
        totalCount?: number;
        totalPages?: number;
    };
    errors?: Array<{
        field?: string;
        message: string;
        code: string;
    }>;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
}

// Customer search request example
interface CustomerSearchRequest {
    filters: {
        companyName?: string;
        industry?: string[];
        revenueRange?: {
            min?: number;
            max?: number;
        };
        territory?: string[];
        assignedUser?: string[];
        customFields?: Record<string, any>;
    };
    sort: Array<{
        field: string;
        direction: 'asc' | 'desc';
    }>;
    pagination: {
        page: number;
        pageSize: number;
    };
    includeFacets?: boolean;
}
```

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Structure
```typescript
// Feature-based folder structure

  components/
    common/               // Shared UI components
      Button/
      Input/
      Modal/
      DataTable/
      SearchInput/
    customers/            // Customer-specific components
      CustomerList/
      CustomerDetail/
      CustomerForm/
      CustomerSearch/
    opportunities/        // Opportunity components

      hooks/             // Custom React hooks
      types/             // TypeScript type definitions
      utils/             // Helper functions
    
  store/                 // Redux state management
    slices/

    api/                 // RTK Query API definitions
      customersApi.ts
      opportunitiesApi.ts
```

#### State Management Patterns
```typescript
// Redux Toolkit Query for server state
export const customersApi = createApi({
    reducerPath: 'customersApi',
    baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
        baseUrl: '/api/v1/customers',
        prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
            headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${getToken(getState())}`);
            return headers;
        },
    }),
    tagTypes: ['Customer', 'CustomerList'],
    endpoints: (builder) => ({
        getCustomers: builder.query<CustomerListResponse, CustomerSearchRequest>({
            query: (searchRequest) => ({
                url: '/search',
                method: 'POST',
                body: searchRequest,
            }),
            providesTags: (result) => [
                'CustomerList',
                ...(result?.data.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'Customer' as const, id })) ?? []),
            ],
        }),
        getCustomer: builder.query<Customer, string>({
            query: (id) => `/${id}`,
            providesTags: (result, error, id) => [{ type: 'Customer', id }],
        }),
        updateCustomer: builder.mutation<Customer, { id: string; data: Partial<Customer> }>({
            query: ({ id, data }) => ({
                url: `/${id}`,
                method: 'PUT',
                body: data,
            }),
            invalidatesTags: (result, error, { id }) => [
                { type: 'Customer', id },
                'CustomerList',
            ],
        }),
    }),
});
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies

#### Database Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: pgBouncer with 20 connections per service instance
- **Read Replicas**: 2 read replicas for reporting and analytics queries  
- **Query Optimization**: Materialized views for complex aggregations
- **Partitioning**: Activities table partitioned by month for performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for session data and frequently accessed lookups

#### Frontend Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting with React.lazy()
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large data tables (>1000 rows)
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and dynamic imports
- **Asset Optimization**: Image compression and WebP format

#### API Performance  
- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests/minute per user, 10000/minute per organization
- **Response Compression**: Gzip compression for all API responses
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Field Selection**: GraphQL-style field selection for REST endpoints
- **Background Processing**: Kafka queues for heavy operations

### Security Implementation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth2 + OIDC**: Integration with Azure AD and SAML providers
- **JWT Tokens**: Access tokens (15min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions system
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP and SMS-based MFA
- **Session Security**: Secure cookies with SameSite and HttpOnly flags

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for database and file storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications

## Technical Deep Dive - Customer Search Optimization

### Problem Statement  
Customer search functionality was experiencing significant performance degradation with large datasets (>100K customers). Initial implementation using basic SQL LIKE queries was insufficient for enterprise-scale data.

### Solution Implementation
1. **Full-Text Search**: Implemented PostgreSQL GIN indexes with tsvector
2. **Intelligent Caching**: Redis-based caching for common search patterns  
3. **Query Optimization**: Restructured database queries to use covering indexes
4. **Result Pagination**: Implemented cursor-based pagination for large result sets

### Performance Results
- **Before**: 8-12 seconds for complex searches
- **After**: 600-900ms for equivalent searches  
- **Improvement**: 90%+ performance improvement
- **Scalability**: Tested up to 500K customer records with consistent performance

### Code Examples
```sql
-- Optimized search query with GIN index
SELECT c.id, c.company_name, c.industry, c.annual_revenue
FROM customers c 
WHERE to_tsvector('english', c.company_name || ' ' || COALESCE(c.industry, '')) @@ plainto_tsquery('tech startup')
  AND c.customer_status = 'active'
  AND c.annual_revenue >= 1000000
ORDER BY ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('english', c.company_name), plainto_tsquery('tech startup')) DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
